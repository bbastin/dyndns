## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report vulnerabilities using the Report a vulnerability GitHub feature in the Security tab.
You can find a [tutorial here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
Responsible disclosure is always appreciated, and I will try to address it as fast as possible.
As this is a private hobby project, I can not guarantee any response times.
